## Project Description:

Digital tabletops are often utilized to create natural interfaces for human computer interaction. Previous research has introduced intuitive metaphors for specific interaction scenarios like sketching and multi-user collaboration. However, only few projects have investigated the challenges and possibilities of creating a multi-purpose workplace with a digital tabletop. The PenTable system combines such a tabletop with standard PC interfaces like keyboard, mouse and LCD display. In the setup, the digital tabletop is utilized as a
peripheral display and direct pen input device. This work describes the design of PenTable, proposes applications, and provides a detailed description a custom graphical user interface (GUI) on the tabletop, which consists of shape widgets (sWidgets) and path menus (pMenus). These elements have been designed for the specific requirements of direct input tabletop displays. The thesis also presents the results of a user-study which compares pMenus with standard pop-up menus.
